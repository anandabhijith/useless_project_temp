### Project Description
A fun, slightly clueless chatbot friend. It doesn’t always get things right, but it’s here to keep you entertained with unpredictable answers. Perfect for a lighthearted chat, not perfect answers!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Today's generation always depends on AI tools like chatGPT,copilot etc for every needs rather than using their own brain for creative ideas.
